# Architecture

Status: the S01 package boundaries, local synthetic runtime entries and initial SQLite/D1 intent adapters are implemented. Provider integration, remote authentication and business workflows below remain target design. See [S01 evidence](implementation/S01-evidence.md).

## Components and boundaries

| Layer | Responsibility | Must not do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MCP transport | Identity context, schemas, tool discovery/results, standard annotations | Decide company access from model text or call Fortnox directly |
| Domain services | Company authorization, policy, validation, preparation/execution, deterministic analysis | Depend on Cloudflare bindings or Node filesystem APIs |
| Fortnox adapter | HTTP requests, versioned endpoint mappings, pagination, errors, rate limits and token acquisition | Retry uncertain non-idempotent writes blindly |
| Operational storage | Connections, policy versions, bounded proposals, execution receipts, audit metadata | Mirror the ledger or retain full receipts indefinitely |
| Runtime adapters | Cloudflare or Node hosting, secrets, storage, file streams, clock | Change business behavior between runtimes |
| UI | Setup/admin and embedded receipt/voucher review | Turn a model-supplied confirmation into human approval |

Workspace structure (created in S01; responsibilities expand in later scopes):

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/core` | Pure domain types, policies, validators, analytics |
| `packages/fortnox` | Typed provider client and explicit endpoint corrections |
| `packages/mcp` | Tools, resources, schemas and result envelopes |
| `packages/ui` | Small setup/admin and MCP Apps views |
| `apps/node` | Node HTTP/stdio entry points, SQLite/storage adapter, Docker |
| `apps/worker` | Cloudflare HTTP entry point and platform bindings |
| `apps/shared` | Portable SQL adapter shared by runtime-specific SQLite/D1 bindings |
| `tests` | Synthetic contract, integration and client acceptance evidence |

## Runtime choices

Use the official TypeScript MCP SDK release that passes the supported-client matrix. MCP `2026-07-28` and older client negotiation/compatibility must be evaluated explicitly in S00; a newer protocol must not strand the first ChatGPT target. Pin exact dependency versions and runtime compatibility settings in S01; do not use an untested floating `latest` in release artifacts.

Use runtime input/output validation (a compatible schema library such as Zod), strict TypeScript and a maintained exact-decimal library. TypeScript types alone are insufficient. Keep money lexemes exact at the JSON boundary; do not parse large/precise money through a binary floating-point intermediate before constructing a decimal.

Streamable HTTP is the remote transport. Stdio is an optional local adapter for clients that support it, with explicitly configured company access and logs on stderr. It does not make a localhost server directly accessible to ChatGPT; see [clients](contracts/clients.md).

## Request path

Authenticate → authorize company and module → validate input → resolve provider context → enforce current write/review policy → perform/reconcile request → return structured result and evidence.

Mutations use distinct prepare/execute services when review is required. Every entry path, including batch, UI and developer diagnostics, calls those same services. Generic API passthrough is not exposed.

## Concurrency and state

Rate limiting is scoped to Fortnox client ID and tenant, shared across concurrent requests for the same installation. Serialize token refresh per connection when the refresh-token flow is used. Bound global and per-tenant concurrency to avoid one company starving others.

The storage interface must support atomic compare-and-set, uniqueness and durable write-intent records. For Node, SQLite is the initial single-instance candidate. For Cloudflare, D1/another transactional adapter must demonstrate equivalent primitives. Eventually consistent KV alone is not acceptable for approval consumption or duplicate-write protection. Do not promise safe multi-replica deployment until coordination is tested.

## Long and large work

Page provider reads with item/page/time/byte budgets. Return `complete=false` and continuation information when a budget is hit. Never represent the first page as the whole ledger. Parse SIE and file streams incrementally where possible; keep state bounded. Operations exceeding a runtime's limits must resume explicitly or produce an actionable limit error, not silently truncate.

Workers free-tier CPU limits, schema-catalog size, decimal/SIE parsing and upload size are feasibility gates. Benchmark real representative payloads in S00/S01 and document when a paid plan or Node deployment is required.

## Extension seams

Modules register capabilities and contracts; runtime adapters implement storage/transport; clients advertise UI/file capabilities. Future teams, hosted multi-user operation, payroll expansion and event listeners can extend these seams. They do not justify building a multi-user SaaS control plane now.
