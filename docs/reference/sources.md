## Supplied specification

See [source-lock.json](source-lock.json). It was analyzed locally; no live Fortnox requests were made. The source file is not redistributed here because no license field establishes redistribution terms. Resource counts and original classifications are recorded in [resource-inventory.json](resource-inventory.json).

The snapshot contains mixed API families, missing security declarations for most operations, example/demo auth schemes and inconsistent parameter/schema details. Absence of `security` does not mean anonymous access. Never use an embedded demo authorization URL as an endpoint for this integration.
